Rules for a pig-game are the following.

Players will roll dice in turns trying to get the threshold needed to win the game. In each turn, the player will have the chance to roll dice an unlimited number of times until the dice is 1, in which case the player will lose the overall accumulated score, or he doesn’t want to roll again, and it passes the turn to the next player. The first player that reaches the hardcoded threshold will win the game.
